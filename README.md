# RopeWithProcessing
Simulating rope physics using processing and box 2d. 
This simulation works by using a number of control points for the rope and implementing spring physics between each control point. The rope is rendered by creating a bezier curve through all the control points. It can also simulate a point weight attached to any single control point, allowing a mix of pendulum and free rope physics.
